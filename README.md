## Readius!
Readius is a book swapping app built with React Native, and it’s my very first project using this framework! To try it out, clone the repository, download the Expo app on your phone, and run `npx expo start --tunnel` in your terminal. Then, scan the generated QR code. You'll need the app password to access it, which is **"ReadiusApp"**.

## How it works:
In this first version of Readius, you can upload books to your personal library and explore books on the Explore page by searching for titles, authors, or the usernames of those who uploaded them. When you find a book you like, click on it to view its description. From there, the uploader’s username is displayed—clicking on it will redirect you to their Instagram profile, where you can message them to arrange a swap! They can then search for your username in the Explore page and browse your library to pick a book they’d like in return. If you're the owner of a book, you can edit or delete your listing directly from the book description page.

Happy swapping!
