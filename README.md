##TODO:

- Fixes:
  - block navigation from manually going back to sign up unless user logs out ✅
  - find a way to store images uploaded to display them on any device instead of using the local path as uri (AWS3, Firestore...) ✅ - clear email and password field after user logs in - unhandled rejections like if no banner/pfp are chosen
- Features:
  - adding books and displaying them on each profile (make component for the diplay of the books)
  - searching for books on the main menu (based on title, author...) - notify user that a seconf user wants to swap book
  - accept or deny swap request
  - if accept, user chooses which book they want to swap with
